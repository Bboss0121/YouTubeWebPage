# YouTubeWebPage
I created a responsive YouTube webpage clone using HTML and CSS. It features a clean layout with a header, sidebar, and video grid similar to YouTube's interface. The design adapts to different screen sizes, providing a user-friendly UI that mimics the original YouTube look and feel.
